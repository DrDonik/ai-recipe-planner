## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I don't understand PR 138, fixing issue 117. There are a few comments, and I am not sure whether mergin is safe.

### Prompt 2

Go ahead and fix the try/catch issue first.

### Prompt 3

There seems to have been an error on npm test, or am I mistaken?

### Prompt 4

Yes, add the tests

### Prompt 5

So if the user clicks "copy" in the copypaste dialog and the copying fails, the dialog advances? What use is that? The user would then manually need to go back and copy it again?
