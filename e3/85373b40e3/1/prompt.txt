I have added the ccpm suite and updated AGENTS.md. Can you have a look at the entire codebase and AGENTS.md and help me flesh it out and update it, wherever needed?

What about the structure of AGENTS.md, does it make sense or is it rather chaotic?

Yes, please reorganize.

Create a commit, including the new folders in .claude.
